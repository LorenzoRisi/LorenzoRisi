 👋 Hi, I’m @LorenzoRisi
 👨‍💼 My background is an M.Sc. in Management & Product Development on top of which I've got 5 years working into a fast growing startup (from 4 to 60 individuals within 3 years). 
 👀 I’m passionate of understanding data, work and take insights from them.
 🌱 I’m at the end of the process of learning it through the use of different analytical languages like Python,R,SQL and software tools focused on data mining and visualization.
 💞️ I’m looking to work into a very stimulating and eterogeneus environment where learning new things, adapting to a dynamic context and face new challenges plays a central role.
